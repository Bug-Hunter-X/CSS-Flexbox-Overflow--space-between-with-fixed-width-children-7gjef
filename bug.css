The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error that can lead to unexpected layout issues:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

div > * {
  width: 100px;
}
```

This code intends to distribute three or more child elements evenly across a flex container. However, if a child element has `width: 100px` and the parent is less than 300px wide then there will be an overflow.  `justify-content: space-between` distributes space between items, but if the total width of the items plus the space between them exceeds the container width, items will overflow.
