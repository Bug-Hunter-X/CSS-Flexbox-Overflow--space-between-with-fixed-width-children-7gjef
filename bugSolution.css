The following CSS resolves the overflow issue by allowing the child elements to shrink:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

div > * {
  width: 100px;
  flex-shrink: 1;
}
```

Adding `flex-shrink: 1;` ensures that if the total width of the elements exceeds the container's width, the elements will shrink proportionally to fit within the available space.
